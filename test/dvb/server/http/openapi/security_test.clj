;; The tricky thing about security in OpenAPI is that the :security key (whether
;; it be at the root of the spec or top-level in an operation object) is a
;; sequence of optional security challenges. If any one of them pass, then the
;; entire security check passes. Furthermore, if multiple pass, we want the data
;; from all of them. For example, we might want optional authentication on an
;; endpoint such that when authentication succeeds, we have the authenticated
;; user returned in the data of the security challenge.
