  Design Doc: Proof-of-Concept
================================================================================


Problems
================================================================================

Dative and the OLD are used by linguists and researchers for linguistic fieldwork and data management. However, Dative can no longer be updated, due to bit rot. The OLD does not allow for easy creation of new instances. Finally, users want to be able to (but cannot currently) use Dative in the field without Internet access and then have their offline work automatically sync up with the online OLD.


Solution
================================================================================

We will re-write the OLD and Dative (in Clojure and ClojureScript, respectively) from the ground up in order to address the above problems from the outset. The initial deliverable will be a continuously delivered proof-of-concept online/offline linguistic data management system from the outset. The PoC will have breadth but not depth. It will support a data model that is a subset of that supported by the current Dative/OLD; that is, it will support management of OLD instances, users with privileges on them, and linguistic forms with only transcriptions and metadata.

Once this is complete, a second phase will deliver nearly full feature parity with the current Dative/OLD. Once this Phase II is complete, the OLD, Dative, and DativeTop will support forms, files, collections, corpora, tags, reified searches, etc. This phase will not implement the morphological parsing machinery of the current OLD, which will be left for a potential Phase III epic.


Solution Details: the Online Linguistic Database (OLD)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The OLD will be an OpenAPI-compliant REST API. It will allow authentication via both API key and cookies. It will use PostgreSQL instead of MySQL. It will support multiple OLDs within a single database (using an indexed old_slug column on all tables) as well as a single table for all users, with each user having role-based access to zero or more OLDs. The OLD will support a "sync" (or "rebase") endpoint which will allow a client to POST a changeset and receive a rebased changeset to support read/write sync. The OLD will have observability built in, using statsd for metrics and queryable logs. The OLD will not run potentially massive synchronous updates on multiple forms in response to an update on a single form (as the current OLD does). Finally, the OLD will have indexes on queryable form attributes and will not expose non-query-able attributes in the search API.


Solution Details: Dative
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dative will allow interaction with an OLD. It will support cookie-based authentication, reading and writing of proto-forms, users and OLDs, and viewing of API keys. Dative will be deployed on the same (a subdomain of) URL as the OLD, to avoid CORS issues. We may need to fork the current DativeRF project in order to accomplish all of this.


Solution Details: DativeTop
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DativeTop will allow interaction with local OLDs stored on the user's machine (in the file system and in SQLite databases.) It will allow for sync configuration such that a background process will use the OLD "sync" API to seamlessly sync local changes with remote. Configuring synchronization will require initial autentication via Dative in order to retrieve the API key and store it locally. It will work on Mac and Windows.

All of the above projects will be continuously integrated and delivered via CircleCI. They will be hosted on CIPL servers (or Digital Ocean servers, if that is not possible).


Details of the Phase I: Proof-of-Concept DativeBase
================================================================================

The proof-of-concept goal is for DativeBase to do the following. It models OLDs, users and forms by exposing CRUD operations on each via an OpenAPI-compliant HTTP REST API, the OLD. It also exposes a "rebase" API which will allow an external OLD to request that a supplied changeset be rebased on the target OLD's changeset, in the same manner as Git rebase works. It provides Dative to interact with the OLDs. It provides DativeTop to interact with local OLDs and to sync them with remote ones. To accomplish this, the following components must meet the following requirements.

- OLD(CLJ). The OLD exposes an OpenAPI-compliant REST API for performing CRUD operations on OLDs, users and forms. It also exposes a rebase endpoint which accepts an arbitrary changeset and returns a rebased changeset which the local OLD must use to update its state to match that of the lead OLD.
- Dative(CLJ). This is the currently under development front-end Re-frame app dativerf. It is basically a rewrite of the Dative CoffeeScript app. It should be able to use the REST API of OLD(CLJ) to manage OLDs, users and forms.
- DativeTop(CLJ). This will be a CLJFX (JavaFX) desktop application. It basically works like Dative(CLJ) but with locally-stored SQLite databases (instead of PostgreSQL). It also runs asynchronous processes to synchronize its local OLDs with any leader OLDs that they are following.
- Migrator. This will be a tool that can migrate a legacy OLD to the current OLD version. It should be able to run idempotently and continuously. That is, we should be able to partially migrate legacy OLD data to a WIP current OLD service, at will.


Epic: Phase I: Proof-of-Concept DativeBase
================================================================================

Once this epic is complete, the following will be true.

1. OLDCLJ will be live.
2. DativeCLJ will be live.
3. DativeTopCLJ cross-platform images will be downloadable from dativebase.dative.ca.
4. Operators will be able to migrate legacy OLD data to OLDCLJ.
5. Users will be able to access OLDCLJ from DativeCLJ.
6. Users will be able to construct minimal local OLDs in DativeTopCLJ.
7. Read/write offline/online synchronization with OLDCLJ will work in DativeTop.


Estimate
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Assuming that two points of complexity is approximately one day of developer work and assuming 100 complexity points (see below), I estimate that the PoC DativeBase epic can be completed in 50 full-time developer days or ten weeks of full-time developer work.

At eight hours per day and $50 per hour, the estimated development cost would be $20,000.
